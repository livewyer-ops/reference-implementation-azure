# Local Seed Migration Tasks

## Objective
Replace the current Azure CLI + Helm-based seed phase with an ephemeral local Kubernetes cluster that reconciles the same Azure infrastructure and Helm releases through Crossplane, driven entirely by declarative manifests (`kubectl apply -f seed/`).

- **Current state**
  - Seed bootstrap is executed manually using `kind` + `kubectl`; see quick steps in `docs/SEED_MANUAL.md`.
  - Only declarative manifests remain in `seed/` (Crossplane install bundle, composition, claim example).
  - Operators manually create the `crossplane-system/<clusterConnectionSecretName>` (default `cnoe-kubeconfig`) secret from the remote AKS kubeconfig before applying the claim.

## Preconditions
- Document current seed actions in `Taskfile.yml` (Azure resource creation, Helmfile invocations, secret handling).
- Confirm access to build/publish container images inside the organisation registry.
- Capture credentials for the remote AKS target cluster and supporting Azure identities (service principals, managed identities, Key Vault secrets).
- Ensure `task update:kubeconfig` (or equivalent) has been executed so `private/kubeconfig` exists before observing the real cluster.
- Provide an Azure service principal (clientId/clientSecret/etc.) via `seed/seed-infrastructure-claim.yaml` before applying the seed manifests (do not commit the populated file).

## Task Group 1 â€“ Seed Container Image
1. Define container requirements (kubectl, helmfile, crossplane CLI, Azure CLI?, yq/jq, helm plugins).
2. Create Dockerfile that installs tooling, configures non-root user, and embeds scripts to create the local seed cluster.
3. Implement entrypoint to:
   - Create the local cluster (KinD or K3s) and export kubeconfig.
   - Apply the static kickoff manifest (installs Crossplane + packages via Job) and optionally block for completion.
4. Automate image build/push pipeline (Taskfile target + CI job).

## Task Group 1A â€“ Transition Away from Taskfile
1. Confirm all documentation references the manual commands:
   - `kind create cluster --config kind.yaml --name seed`.
   - `export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/private/seed-kubeconfig` (or set via tooling).
   - Copy/edit `seed/seed-infrastructure-claim.yaml.example` (fill every placeholder, including clientSecret).
   - `kubectl apply -f seed/` followed by `kubectl wait deployment/crossplane -n crossplane-system --for=condition=Available --timeout=10m`.
2. Validate that no CI or docs still reference removed `task seed:*` targets.

## Task Group 2 â€“ Ephemeral Local Cluster Bootstrap
1. Select local distro (KinD preferred) and capture cluster config (node labels, storage).
2. Write script/Taskfile target to spin up/down the cluster for each run.
3. Ensure kubeconfig is mounted into container and exported for Crossplane installation.

## Task Group 3 â€“ Crossplane Core Setup
1. Package Crossplane helm install into bootstrap manifest (`ProviderConfig` namespace, RBAC).
2. Install Crossplane providers:
   - `provider-jet-azure` (or successor) for Azure resources.
   - `provider-helm` for remote chart deployments.
3. Configure provider credentials via Kubernetes Secrets referenced in `ProviderConfig` objects.

## Task Group 4 â€“ Azure Resource Reconciliation
1. Inventory all `az` commands in the seed tasks (managed identities, key vault, DNS, etc.).
2. Map each resource to Crossplane managed resources or compositions; document gaps.
3. Author Crossplane `CompositeResourceDefinitions`/`Compositions` to encapsulate required Azure objects.
4. Create parameter definitions for values currently sourced from `config.yaml`.
5. Implement dependency ordering using `DependsOn` or composition topology.

## Task Group 5 â€“ Helm Release Migration
1. Translate Helmfile releases into `HelmRelease` managed resources via `provider-helm`.
2. Externalize chart values from existing `packages/*/values.yaml` into Crossplane-friendly secrets/configmaps.
3. Define connection secrets for each release (URLs, credentials) for later Taskfile consumption.

## Task Group 6 â€“ Remote Cluster Credential Injection
1. âœ… Documented manual step to create the kubeconfig secret prior to applying the claim.
2. Capture troubleshooting guidance for stale or missing kubeconfig secrets (e.g., how to rebuild from `private/kubeconfig`).
3. Document the rotation flow for the service-principal secret and the kubeconfig secret (delete + recreate secret, re-apply claim).
4. Confirm Helm provider connectivity against a real AKS cluster once workloads are deployed.

## Task Group 7 â€“ Single Manifest Assembly
1. Create `seed-kickoff.yaml` aggregating:
   - Namespace scaffolding.
   - Crossplane installation (Helm chart rendered to YAML).
   - Provider packages, secrets, compositions, and claims.
   - Any CRDs required for compositions.
2. Document ordering/health checks for reconciliation before destroying the local cluster (e.g., wait for the bootstrap job, confirm providers are healthy).

## Task Group 8 â€“ Integration & Cleanup
1. Update documentation, onboarding scripts, and pipelines to call the manual seed commands directly.
2. Provide optional helper scripts or containers (e.g., `seed/Dockerfile`) while keeping them detached from Taskfile.
3. Ensure manual cleanup guidance (delete secrets, remove KinD cluster) is consistently communicated.

## Task Group 10 â€“ Remaining Follow-up
1. Validate the new pipeline-based Composition (`seed-infrastructure`) against real AKS environments and capture any additional requirements (permissions, managed identity scopes). ðŸ”„
2. Document day-2 operations for the claim (updating parameters, deleting resources) and integrate with platform runbooks. ðŸ”„
3. Manual flow documented; review whether further automation is required. âœ…

## Task Group 9 â€“ Validation
1. Create acceptance checklist verifying Azure resources and Helm releases match prior implementation.
2. Add smoke tests executed inside container (e.g., `helm status`, `az resource show` via Crossplane outputs).
3. Run regression against staging AKS cluster; capture timing and failure modes.

## Current Outstanding Tasks
- Expand documentation/runbooks with troubleshooting steps for missing/incorrect kubeconfig secrets (how to regenerate, expected secret structure).
- Define and automate (where possible) the rotation process for both the Azure service principal and the kubeconfig secret.
- Explore future Crossplane provider improvements that would allow read-only kubeconfig retrieval without manual secrets.
